## Introduction
- Joke Generator is a web-based application that pulls from the public API 
https://v2.jokeapi.dev/. The theme is that the app is an easy way to develope
skills in humour by providing the user with random jokes at any given time with
the ability to filter jokes based on the level of appropriateness necessary for
a given audience.

## Requirements
- The app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. The API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.
- The entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, the project will contain a single HTML file.
- The app needs to have at least 3 unique event-listeners that enable interactivity. These include search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each listener should listen for a different type of event and must use addEventListener() to add the event.
- The project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating the API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement the array iteration.
